# Look and Say!

Create a function which returns a sequence of the numbers according to the rules below.

If this function receives '1', it should return '1'.   
If it receives '2', it should return '11'.  
If it receives '3', it should return '21', and so on:

```
1 -> 1
2 -> 11
3 -> 21
4 -> 1211
5 -> 111221
6 -> 312211
7 -> 13112221
```

Identify the rule of this sequence and implement the function.

## How to implement
Build the solution as a CLI application.  
Input parameters will be passed as an argument of CLI, and
the Output should be written to stdout.

You can use the following languages to solve this challenge.

- NodeJS
- Ruby
- Python3
- Go
- Java

How to make a CLI application with each language is explained in [YOUR LANGUAGE].md

## Secret Test
You can see 7 testcases in [testcase.js](test/testcase.js).
However, this challenge has 3 additional hidden testcases:

- SecretTest1. Passes an integer of '8', and expects a correct answer.
- SecretTest2. Passes an integer of '20', and expects a correct answer.
- SecretTest3. Passes an integer of '10000'. Find the initial 500 digits of the expected output, and write this in the first line of [answer.md](answer.md). Explain how you solved the problem beginning from line 2.

If your function is implemented correctly, the first 2 tests will pass.

However, if your implementation is too earnest, the last question will eat up all of your memory! :(
Try to find a way to optimize.

PS:
The secret tests will run only when the challenge is submitted,
and the results are never shown in the WebEditor.
